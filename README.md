# ChatApp

This chat application is for the Class SENG 513 Assignment 3

To run the code simply pull the code down from github, navigate to the repository using the command prompt, and type node index.js
This will run the server, then enter a browser and type localhost:3000. The browser will open the chat application.

Note: depending on the window size, the user column may be displayed below due to flex view, if this is the case just increase the size of the browser and
then decrease again. This was done to ensure that on a mobile phone the text won't be so small that it is impossible to read.

Note: If the server shuts off but a client is still on the webpage, then it is recommended to refresh the page otherwise there may be problems with the connecting.
